# ATC-MK2

In this repository files for an autonomous robotic rover which avoids obstacles are shown.
This rover uses an ultrasonic sensor to sense distance to objects nearby. The novelty about
this ATC version is that it uses the Zybo Z7 FPGA board as its controller. The program for
actuation and distance measurement was custom made in C. FPGA board was configured using
blocks in Vivado and the C program was written in Xilinx SDK.
